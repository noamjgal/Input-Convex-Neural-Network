# Input-Convex-Neural-Network
This Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) script is a first stage draft that was developed further in a wider machine learning optimization project on normalizing flows in the optimal transport problem under the supervision of Dr. Giulio Trigila and Dr. Ricardo Baptista. 

The main collaborators on the ICNN are Kason Ancelin, Noam Gal and Josef Sajonz.
