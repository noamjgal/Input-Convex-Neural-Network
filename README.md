# Input-Convex-Neural-Network
This input convex neural network is part of a larger research project on normalizing flows as implemented in the optimal transport problem. This project is being undertaken as part of the Polymath Jr. REU under the guidance of Dr. Giulio Trigila and Dr. Ricardo Baptista. The ICNN subproject collaborators are Noam Gal, Kason Ancelin, and Josef Sajonz.
