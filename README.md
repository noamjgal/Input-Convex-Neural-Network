# Input-Convex-Neural-Network
This Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) project is part of a wider machine learning optimization project on normalizing flows in the optimal transport problem that is being undertaken through the 2022 Polymath Jr. REU under the supervision of Dr. Giulio Trigila and Dr. Ricardo Baptista. 

The main collaborators on the ICNN are Kason Ancelin, Noam Gal and Josef Sajonz.
